The "App Setup" Checklist
1. Connect your Data
In the AppSheet Editor, go to Data > Tables.

Add your Google Sheet tabs (e.g., ktd_production_log, ktd_inventory).

2. Create your Slices (The Logic Filters)
Active Plan Slice: Filter condition [status] <> "DISMISSED".

Low Stock Slice: Filter condition [quantity] < [reorder_level].

3. Create your Actions (The Buttons/Swipes)
Mark Completed: Set [status] to "COMPLETED".

Dismiss: Set [status] to "DISMISSED". (Set Appearance to "Do not display").

4. Build the Views (The UI)
Go to App > Views and create the views from our list. For each view:

Assign it a Name (e.g., "Active Plan").

Select the Data Source (The Table or the Slice).

Select the View Type (Deck, Table, Form, or Gallery).

5. Apply Format Rules (The Colors)
Go to App > Format Rules.

Rule 1: If [status] = "PLANNED", set color to Pink.
