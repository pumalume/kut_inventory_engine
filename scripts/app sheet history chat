1. The "Smart Gallery" View
Instead of just a blank form, we create a Gallery View or Deck View based on your "Smart View" (v_ktd_production_frequency).

Sorting: We sort this view by prod_count (Descending). This puts the most-made items right at the top of his screen.

The Trigger: We set the "Event Action" for this view. When he taps an item (e.g., Tulumba), it doesn't just "show" the product; it triggers an action to "Add a new row to another table using values from this row."

2. The Form & The "Planned" Status
When he taps the product in the gallery:

AppSheet opens the ktd_production_log form automatically.

The Product Name is already filled in.

The Status is automatically set to PLANNED (using the "Initial Value" property).

The keyboard pops up for the Quantity.

3. The "Return to Main" Logic (Finish View)
You mentioned wanting to return to the main view after saving.

In the Form View settings for the production log, there is a property called "Finish View".

We set this to your "Production Plan" view.

The Result: He taps "Tulumba" -> Types "20" -> Hits "Save" -> The app immediately slides back to his main Production Plan list where he can see the new item waiting.

GitHub Diary Entry: UX Logic
Here is the entry for your project history:

Title: Intuitive Production Entry Flow
Strategy: "Selection-First" data entry to minimize typing and errors. Workflow Implementation:

Source: v_ktd_production_frequency (SQL View).

Entry Point: A Gallery View acting as a "Product Menu" sorted by historical frequency.

Action: An App: go to another view within this app action that pre-fills the ktd_production_log form with the selected product_id.

Navigation: Configured "Finish View" logic to redirect the user back to the active "Production Plan" slice upon save. Outcome: A high-speed, 3-tap process for adding new production orders, keeping the owner in the main operational view at all times.

Ready for the Connection?
To make this "Save" button actually talk to your MySQL server and trigger the inventory deduction, you need the bridge.

Would you like the "Universal Push/Pull" script now? This will ensure that when he hits "Save" and then later hits "Complete," the server does all the recipe math we've built.
